            <h2>About</h2>
            <h3>Current Work</h3>
            <p>I am currently a lab manager at Brown University, where I work with <a href="https://sites.brown.edu/bltlab/people/"> Roman Feiman</a> to
                 build research projects using JavaScript and Python. Occasionally I will develop iPad apps for the aforementioned research studies, as 
                 well as create 3D models using Blender. Currently, I am developing a FileMaker app for the Brown Developmental labs to use for recruitment
                  and study tracking.</p>
            <p>I am also currently attending Boston University as an online Masters student in the Computer Information Systems discipline. I have created a
                 relational database project on Nursing Home admissions using SQL, and I have built a simple catalogue using Python. Because I love to learn,
                  it's been really fun thus far!</p>
            <h3>Interests</h3>
            <p>Professionally, I have had the most fun when learning how to turn our JavaScript web app into a working iOS app. While it was intimidating at 
                first, I felt so proud when the app finally came together! I am also quite interested in getting better at the things that I already know. 
                Therefore, I am excited to be taking a course that will be going over Vue.js. I also want to convert another study to React instead of relying 
                on PHP and JS scripts to work!</p>
            <p> In my spare time, I love playing video games with my friends and cuddling with my two cats! I enjoy teaching my husband new words in ASL and 
                reading together on the couch. Making Blender animations is also a lot of fun, so I am looking forward to having more time to spend on improving
                 my modeling skills soon.</p>
