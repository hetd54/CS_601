                    <h2>1994</h2>
                    <p>I was born in December of 1994, becoming my parents' second child and daughter. I'm happy 
                        that I was not born a boy, as my dad is insistent they would have named me "Gee Tarr".</p>

                    <h2>1994-2008</h2>
                    <p>I had 9 surgeries between 3 months of age through 12 years of age because I was born with a 
                        cleft lip and palate. Through a lot of hard work and because of the skills of my surgical team
                         back in St. Louis, I talk normally and scarring is pretty minimal!</p>

                    <h2>2003</h2>
                    <p>My aunt brought home her wonderful daughter Maddie from China. I nannied for my aunt throughout 
                        Maddie's childhood, and I love her so much. Nannying Maddie really made me want to be a mom since 
                        she was SO cute and so much fun to nanny, and she will forever hold a special place in my heart.</p>

                    <p>I graduated high school and undergrad, respectively! I actually started out pre-vet because I love 
                        animals, but all the shadowing of vets made me switch to Psychology.</p>

                    <p>A lot happened in 2017: I traveled outside the country for the first time, I moved across the 
                        country to Boston, and I started my very first "big kid" job as a lab manager.</p>

                    <p>In 2020, I lost both of my grandparents on my dad's side. They were incredibly supportive of me, and 
                        my grandma would be SO pleased that I want to transition to be a software engineer. She was always 
                        sending me articles on women in engineering along with cat stories. I still feel so much grief that 
                        I could not see them or support my grandpa due to the pandemic.</p>

                    <h2>2021</h2>
                    <p>In 2021, my husband and I were able to snag a house at a low interest rate because we did not have a 
                        wedding (saved a lot of money) and because of insane luck. I love my house. I do not like leaving 
                        my house.</p>
